# README: Image Generator using DCGAN

## Overview
This project implements an Image Generator using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). The `ImageGeneratorDCGAN.ipynb` notebook demonstrates training a GAN to generate realistic images from random noise.

## Features
- Implementation of a DCGAN architecture.
- Training a generator and discriminator network.
- Using convolutional layers for feature extraction and generation.
- Generating high-quality synthetic images.
- Visualization of generated images over training epochs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive execution.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning.
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization.
- **Torchvision** for dataset preprocessing.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ImageGeneratorDCGAN.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, define the DCGAN model, and start training.
3. Monitor the training process through loss graphs and generated image samples.
4. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for better results.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with different dataset types for varied image generation.
- Improve model architecture for better image quality.
- Implement conditional GANs (cGANs) for controlled image generation.
- Optimize training time and efficiency using GPU acceleration.
